/**
 * Normalise whatever the user typed into the Onboarding URL field into a usable HA
 * server base URL. The logic is small but worth its own file so it can be unit-tested
 * directly: the VM that wraps it (OnboardingViewModel.probe) has lifecycle, network,
 * and coroutine machinery that's an awkward harness for a string-in / string-out
 * function.
 *
 * Rules applied in order:
 *
 *   1. Trim surrounding whitespace and strip a single trailing slash.
 *   2. If the input is empty after trimming, return empty (caller surfaces an error).
 *   3. If the input already starts with `http://` or `https://`, the user chose the
 *      protocol on purpose. Return it verbatim — no inference, no port addition. The
 *      user with a reverse-proxy at `http://example.com/ha` does not want the port
 *      magicked into the middle of their URL.
 *   4. Otherwise (no scheme), the user typed something shaped like a host. We pick
 *      the protocol and add the default HA port if needed:
 *        - mDNS hosts (`*.local`), `localhost`, and the private IPv4 ranges
 *          (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 127/8) get `http://`. Bare hostnames with
 *          no dots also fall here. These are the LAN cases where TLS is rare and
 *          HA's default port is 8123. If the user didn't already type a port, we
 *          append `:8123`.
 *        - Anything else with a dot is treated as a public DNS name and gets
 *          `https://`. Cloud HA installs (Nabu Casa, self-hosted with Let's Encrypt)
 *          are almost always HTTPS-only on the implicit :443.
 *
 * The function is pure: no logging, no toasts, no settings reads. Tests in
 * UrlNormalizerTest exercise every branch.
