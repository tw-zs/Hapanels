/**
 * Tiny image loader for the now-playing album art and any other one-off
 * Compose-rendered bitmap. No Glide / Coil dependency — the R1 use case is
 * one or two album covers visible at a time, so a per-composable LaunchedEffect
 * that fetches the bytes and decodes via BitmapFactory is plenty.
 *
 * **Caching.** Backed by [AsyncBitmapCache] — an in-memory LRU of decoded
 * [ImageBitmap]s (so swiping back to a previously-seen card paints instantly,
 * no re-decode) plus an OkHttp disk cache shared by every fetch (so re-opening
 * the app pulls the cover from disk instead of refetching over WLAN). On the
 * slow panel boot paths the difference is the album cover appearing in the same
 * frame as the rest of the card rather than ~300 ms later.
 *
 * Handles three URL shapes coming from HA's `entity_picture` attribute:
 *  1. Absolute `http(s)://…` — used verbatim.
 *  2. Relative `/api/media_player_proxy/…` — prepended with the configured HA
 *     server URL.
 *  3. `data:image/…` data URIs — split and decoded as base64 in place. Data
 *     URIs are NOT cached on disk (they're inline already and the LRU is
 *     enough) but DO go through the in-memory LRU.
 *
 * Failures (network down, decode error, 404 on the proxy) render a quiet
 * placeholder instead of throwing; the album cover is a nice-to-have, not a
 * must-have, and a broken image rotating in a corner of the card would be
 * worse than a clean fallback.
