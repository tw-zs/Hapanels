 * Modal for adding, renaming, or deleting a page. Two modes share the same panel

 *
 *  * **Add mode** ([isAdd] = true, [page] = null) — single text field defaulting
 *    to "NEW", a SAVE button and a CANCEL chip. No DELETE row.
 *  * **Edit mode** ([isAdd] = false, [page] non-null) — text field pre-filled
 *    with the page's current name; SAVE renames, CANCEL discards. A DELETE
 *    button appears below when [canDelete] is true (i.e. there's more than one
 *    page — the user can never delete their last page out from under the deck).
 *
 * Styling follows the rename-dialog conventions: dim backdrop, sharp 2 dp panel,
 * hairline border, monospace where it helps. Back press dismisses, matching the
 * other R1 modals.
