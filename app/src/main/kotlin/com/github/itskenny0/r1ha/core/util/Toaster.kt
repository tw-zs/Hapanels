/**
 * Process-scoped toast helper. Initialised once from [com.github.itskenny0.r1ha.App.onCreate];
 * any code (including ViewModels and repositories) can then call into this object
 * without holding its own Context reference.
 *
 * **Two visibility tiers.** The user reported that even non-error toasts ("Session
 * refreshed", "Signed out") were showing up with toasts otherwise disabled, which was
 * the result of every call going through the force-show path. Now:
 *
 *  - [error] / [errorExpandable] — force-show via [R1Toast.userPush]. Use for failure
 *    feedback the user genuinely needs to see regardless of their toast preferences
 *    (HA call rejected, save failed, decrypt failed, etc.). Bypasses [R1Toast.enabled]
 *    and [R1Toast.minLevel].
 *  - [show] / [showExpandable] — gated INFO via [R1Toast.push]. Use for confirmations
 *    and progress chatter ("Backup restored", "Loaded N entities"). Only surfaces
 *    when the user has opted into the diagnostic feed at INFO or DEBUG in Settings.
 *
 * **Why no Android Toast.** Tiny 240×320 displays truncate the OS Toast at ~28
 * chars mid-sentence — failure messages like "Validation error: Entity
 * media_player.foo doesn't support media_next_track" were getting clipped before the
 * user could read what went wrong. Every Toaster call routes through R1Toast which
 * renders an expandable in-app toast (tap for full text) via [ui.components.ToastHost]
 * mounted at the activity root. We keep the [init] entry point for back-compat with
 * the App.onCreate wiring even though we no longer need the Application reference.
