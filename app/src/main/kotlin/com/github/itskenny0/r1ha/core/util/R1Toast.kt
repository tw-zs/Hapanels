/**
 * Process-scoped in-app toast bus — replaces the OS Toast that tiny 240×320
 * display truncated mid-sentence for any non-trivial message. Each pushed event
 * carries the full text; the rendering layer (see `ToastHost` in feature/cardstack
 * or wherever it's mounted) shows a short version by default and expands to the
 * full text on tap.
 *
 * Two intentional design choices:
 *
 *  1. **Bus, not single-shot.** R1Log writes to this bus on every call. The user
 *     sets a [minLevel] in Settings → Behaviour → Toast log level (default OFF) to
 *     filter what actually reaches the toast UI. Setting it to WARN turns the toast
 *     into a live diagnostic feed without flooding the screen with INFO chatter.
 *  2. **No app-context required.** Unlike the OS Toast, callers don't have to hold
 *     an Application instance. Push from anywhere — repositories, value-class
 *     init blocks, deeply nested coroutines — and the host-side Compose subscriber
 *     picks it up.
