 * (the official media-player proxy does this) and a Bearer header is redundant.
 * Other integrations — and any plain `/api/...` path — require normal HA auth, and

 * harmless in the first case (HA ignores it when a token query param is present) and

 * on the providing scope, and the VerticalPager's per-page EntityCard is skippable so
 * it wouldn't recompose with the new map until something else dirtied it (in practice,
 * an app restart). That regression is exactly what motivated this comment; please don't
 * "optimize" it back to the static variant without first verifying live updates still
