/**
 * Width-based responsive tier the current composition is rendering in.
 *
 * Compact panel screens report ~320-340 dp wide depending on the active
 * `wm density`, so anything <= 360 dp is treated as the smallest tier and
 * rendered exactly as before (no regressions on small portrait displays).
 *
 * `PHONE` covers most modern phones (typically 360–500 dp portrait); the
 * layout stays single-column but gets a small breathing-room cap so a
 * landscape phone or a tall narrow tablet column doesn't stretch tiles
 * absurdly wide. `TABLET` is everything above — centred narrow column
 * (or a 2-column dashboard) so an 8″ tablet doesn't render a single card
 * across 1200 dp.
 *
 * Thresholds match the Material 3 window-size-class breakpoints loosely
 * — but we keep the lower one at 360 dp so compact panels sit squarely in
 * the smallest bucket regardless of LineageOS GSI density tweaks.
