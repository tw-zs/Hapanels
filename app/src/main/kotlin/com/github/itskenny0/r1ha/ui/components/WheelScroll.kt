/**
 * Drive [listState] with the physical scroll wheel: each detent scrolls by ~[stepDp] dp,
 * animated so the motion feels native instead of snapping. Each screen that wants wheel
 * scrolling calls this once at composition; collection automatically suspends when the
 * screen leaves composition, so wheel events fired from elsewhere don't accidentally
 * scroll a Settings page that isn't visible.
 *
 * When [settings] is provided and the user has wheel acceleration enabled, the per-event
 * scroll distance scales with how fast the user is spinning — same rate-window logic as
 * CardStackViewModel. A slow tick gives `stepDp`; a sustained spin gives up to ~7× that.
 * The acceleration kicks in around 5 events/sec which is the rate where a finger drag is
 * clearly continuous rather than discrete taps.
